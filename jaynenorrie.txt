// O FLOWER OF SCOTLAND

O Flower of Scotland,
When will we see
Your like again,
That fought and died for,
Your wee bit Hill and Glen,
And stood against him,
Proud Edward's Army,
And sent him homeward,
To think again. 

Ruairidh is the best TL of all time!
(I have been practising how to spell your name :D)
